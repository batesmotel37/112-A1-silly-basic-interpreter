SBI, or Silly Basic Interpreter, takes in a program written in Silly Basic (a simplified version of basic), and executes the commands in it.



CMPS 112 Assignment 1: Functionally Scheme
This program was completed using pair programming.
Me: Sean Mendonca (smendonc@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Kenneth High (khigh@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Sean Mendonca spent 5 hours working alone.
Kenneth High spent 5 hours working alone.
We spent 10 hours working together.
Sean Mendonca spent 5 hours driving.

Some Notes for the Grader(s)/User(s):

You may notice that when you run the tests through a
shell script, some of the tests (specifically 32, 33, and 40)
will only print out error reports. Please be sure to additionally
run these tests alone in the terminal. 

I found that when I ran these through a shell script, only the 
errors were printed, but when I ran them by hand, I was able to 
run through one cycle before encountering the program crashing 
error (I believe I narrowed down the cause to a problem with 
my input function).
